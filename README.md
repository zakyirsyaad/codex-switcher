## Installation

### Download a Release

The easiest way to install Codex Switcher is from the latest GitHub release:

[Download the latest release](https://github.com/Lampese/codex-switcher/releases/latest)

Choose the file for your platform:

- **macOS Apple Silicon:** `Codex.Switcher_*_aarch64.dmg`
- **macOS Intel:** `Codex.Switcher_*_x64.dmg`
- **Windows:** `Codex.Switcher_*_x64-setup.exe` or `Codex.Switcher_*_x64_en-US.msi`
- **Linux Debian/Ubuntu:** `Codex.Switcher_*_amd64.deb`
- **Linux AppImage:** `Codex.Switcher_*_amd64.AppImage`
- **Linux RPM:** `Codex.Switcher-*-1.x86_64.rpm`

> **macOS:** current release builds are not Apple-notarized. If macOS says the
> app is damaged, move it to `/Applications` and remove the quarantine flag:
>
> ```bash
> sudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Codex Switcher.app"
> open "/Applications/Codex Switcher.app"
> ```

### Auto Updates

Codex Switcher checks the latest GitHub release on startup. When a newer signed
update package is available, the app shows an update prompt and can install it
from inside the app.

### Build from Source

#### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Lampese/codex-switcher.git
cd codex-switcher

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run in development mode
pnpm tauri dev

# Build for production
pnpm tauri build
```

> **Windows:** the `pnpm tauri` script runs through a POSIX shell wrapper
> (`sh ./scripts/tauri.sh`) and will not work in PowerShell/CMD. Use the
> `tauri:win` script instead: `pnpm tauri:win dev` and `pnpm tauri:win build`.

The built application will be in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

### Run the Dashboard in a Browser

You can also serve the built dashboard over HTTP instead of opening the Tauri shell.

```bash
# Build the frontend and start the web server on 0.0.0.0:3210
pnpm lan
```

Optional environment variables:

- `CODEX_SWITCHER_WEB_HOST` to override the bind host
- `CODEX_SWITCHER_WEB_PORT` to override the port

The browser dashboard serves the same UI and backend actions through `/api/invoke/*`, which makes it usable over LAN, Tailscale, or a remote host tunnel when you expose the chosen port safely.

## Versioning

Use the version bump helper to keep app versions in sync across Tauri, Cargo, and the frontend.

```bash
# Exact version
pnpm version:bump 0.2.1

# Semver bumps
pnpm version:patch
pnpm version:minor
pnpm version:major

# Prepare a release commit and tag
# This automatically runs the version bump first.
pnpm release patch

# Prepare and push a release
# This automatically runs the version bump first.
pnpm release patch -- --push
```
